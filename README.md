OMG, just walked out of The Legend of Ochi—I swear I’m still spinning. The theater was, like, way too loud and my back’s killing me from those seats, but holy moly, what a ride. My popcorn dropped, and now I’m picking crumbs out of my sweater, but that’s beside the point. So there’s this girl, right? She’s lost or found—couldn’t really tell—and then, these creatures, kinda like if cats decided to become clouds. Or ostriches. It all felt like a dream, the way a radio sounds underwater.

> The music was like someone just grabbed space and squeezed it, made my ears feel like marshmallows. And there’s a forest, which is soooo beautifully green; like when you leave spinach too long and it gets that deep jungle green. I think I missed a bit while texting. Or maybe I was just lost. It's like you bake a cake and realize you forgot the sugar but it’s still sweet somehow???

Oh, someone totally asked if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, and I can’t remember my answer. Brain's all mushy from the visuals—too many colors pranced across the screen, like my granny’s garden after a rainstorm, vivid but kinda too bright, y’know?

And there was a character, I think his hat was taller than my husband’s fishing stories. Seriously. Then Ochi, or was it Mochi? It’s like trying to follow a recipe without instructions, all chaos but in a delightful way. At some point, I thought I saw a chicken, but that might’ve been my imagination, or a shadow. Or both.

𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for a second 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Maybe. Feel like it’s needed just to untangle it in my head. Like knitting with spaghetti—an adventure, totally worth it.

Here: 
```cpp
int main() {
    return ; //oops, what's this doing here?
}
```
